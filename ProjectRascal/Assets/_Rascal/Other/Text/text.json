It's in the ruins northeast of here, but I'll give you the exact location when we meet. The only thing left is our partner. Now we don't need Ron for anything. I've locked him in our cabin, he's asleep for now and doesn't suspect anything. Send one of your assassins here to handle it.\n\nSee you soon,\nH." ,
